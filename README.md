# 🏪 Supermarket Transactions Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes supermarket transaction data to extract key business insights. The analysis answers questions related to **cash purchases, store spending behavior, and customer segmentation** to help optimize business decisions.

## 📊 Business Impact
- **Identified key spending patterns** to optimize marketing strategies.
- **Analyzed non-member customer behavior** to improve loyalty programs.
- **Provided transaction breakdowns** to enhance pricing & inventory decisions.

## 📂 Dataset
- **`data/supermarket_transactions.csv`**: Contains transaction details (date, store, product, price, payment method, customer type).
- **`data/cleaned_transactions.csv`**: Processed dataset with cleaned & structured data.

## 🔍 Key Findings
1. **X apples purchased using cash**, accounting for $Y in revenue.
2. **Bakershire store’s non-member spending amounted to $Z** across all payment methods.
3. **Identified purchasing patterns by payment method and store location.**

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated
